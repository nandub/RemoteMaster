This project contains the full release of jni4net from jni4net.com/index.html together with a folder RMIRWin10BLE of files for its use to generate the Java implementation of Windows 10 BLE support for RMIR from its C# project.  The C# project builds the file RMIRWin10BLE.dll that is the sole input needed for proxygen.exe of jni4net.  This proxy generation creates a set of .java, .dll and .jar files that all need to be copied as source files for RMIR.  The RMIRWin10BLE folder contains a command file generateProxies.cmd that automates all the copying and proxy generation into one batch operation.  This file requires editing to change the paths of the C#  and Java projects to those of your setup.  Comments are included in the batch file to indicate the necessary changes.  The input and output files in this folder are the current versions provided as an example.  They will not be kept up-to-date.  The source file Win10BLE.cs of the C# project is the only true source required and that will be updated as necessary.
