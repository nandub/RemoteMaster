        <irp:documentation>
            A relaxed form (but used in some real devices) of the <a href="#NEC1">NEC1</a> protocol. Byte 3 and byte 4 are independent.
	    NEC1-Yamaha is a special case of this, in which bytes 3 and 4 are related but in a different manner than in a standard
	    NEC1 signal.  The NEC1 standard is that byte 4 is the complement of byte 3.  The relationship in an NEC1-Yamaha signal
	    is determined by a style parameter with values Y1, Y2 and Y3 as follows:
            <p>Y1: Only bits 0-6 are complemented.<br/>
            Y2: Only bits 1-7 are complemented.<br/>
            Y3: Only bits 1-6 are complemented.</p>
