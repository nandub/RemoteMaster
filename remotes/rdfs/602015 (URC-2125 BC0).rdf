Notes=With the remote face down, pin 1 of the 5-pin connector is on the left. \ 
      Pins 1 to 5 of the connector correspond to pins 1,2,3,4,6 of a standard \
      6-pin connector.\n\n\
      The device button named Extra is a phantom device with a standard structure, \
      that named CableRF cannot be selected directly but is the RF setup for the \
      Cable device, corresponding to the Cable device button that is its IR setup. \ 
      The names are JP1 names, not UEI ones.  The Input punchthrough affects only the \
      Input button, use of the X and Z punchthroughs is unknown as they appear not to \
      affect any buttons.
